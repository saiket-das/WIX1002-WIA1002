## Tutorial 6 - Priority Queue

### Question 1

Describe the main difference between Queue and PriorityQueue.

Queue

- FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
- Element insert at the end and remove from the front.
- Example: A bunch of people line-up for a service.

Priority Queue

- Elemenets are order by priority, not by inserting order.
- Element with the highest priority removes first
- Example: Task scheduling where urgent task handles before other.
