## Tutorial 5 - Stack

### Question 1

The stack method that returns an element from the stack without removing it is **\_**.

- **(a)** pop
- **(b)** push
- **(c)** peek ✅
- **(d)** spy

---

### Question 2

Initial stacks:
s1 = [0, 1, 2], s2 = [], s3 = []

After operations:
s1 = [2], s2 = [], s3 = []

---

### Question 3

Over time, the elements 1, 2, and 3 are pushed onto a stack in that order. For each of the following, indicate (**yes** or **no**) whether the sequence could be created by popping operations. If **yes**, list the sequence of `push()` and `pop()` operations that produce the sequence.

- **(a)** 1-2-3
- **(b)** 2-3-1
- **(c)** 3-2-1 ✅
- **(d)** 1-3-2

---

### Question 4

Convert the following infix expressions to postfix:

- **(a)** `a + b * c`  
  → `a b c * +`

- **(b)** `a * b – c / d`  
  → `a b * c d / -`

- **(c)** `a + (b * c + d) / e`  
  → `a b c * d + e / +`

---

### Question 5

Write the following expressions in infix form:

- **(a)** `a b + c *`  
  → `(a + b) * c`

- **(b)** `a b c + *`  
  → `a * (b + c)`

---

### Question 6

Which of the following is an application of stack?

- **(a)** finding factorial
- **(b)** tower of Hanoi
- **(c)** infix to postfix
- **(d)** all of the above ✅
